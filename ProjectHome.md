## What is it? ##

SPAGS is a library that may be useful to people making editor plugins for [Adventure Game Studio](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk) that involve processing scripts written in AGS' own scripting language. This is particularly useful if you want to create a plugin for exporting/converting game resources to some other format.

**Disclaimer:** The parser is completely unofficial and not the same as what is used internally by AGS. There may still be things it does not support.

_(SPAGS is not to be confused with [SPAG - Society for the Promotion of Adventure Games](http://www.sparkynet.com/spag/).)_
